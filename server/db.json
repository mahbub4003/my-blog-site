Here, we will walk through the BARE MINIMUM of what you need to do to mock this functionality.",

      "des": "Routing is a topic most of us are familiar with. However, SPA frameworks and routing libraries use different techniques underneath. Two such approaches are static and dynamic routing. Frameworks like Angular, Ember and React Router library (in the past) supported static routing.  But recently, React Router introduced dynamic routing to address some of the core limitations with static routing.  As developers, we should be aware of both these techniques, and this article will give you all the answers you need on static and dynamic routing in React.",
